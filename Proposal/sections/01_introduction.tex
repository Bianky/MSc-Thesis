Tropical forest 

Tropical forests are the world's key ecosystems accommodating a wide diversity of species, ..., and playing a fundamental role in the global carbon and water cycles \citep{bormaCarbonContributionsSouth2022}. However, over half of the tropical forests have been deforested and converted into other land use types leading to losses of these vital ecosystem services \citep{chazdonNaturalRegenerationTool2016}. 

Natural forest regeneration is an effective tool for various ecological restoration efforts such as climate change mitigation, biodiversity conservation, or soil health restoration \citep{hordijkLandUseHistory2024}. % here we could talk more specifically about ecological efforts and societal 
It supports global ambitions such as the restoration of 3.5 million $km^2$ of degraded land \citep{holl2017restoring} and aligns with the UN Decade on Ecosystem Restoration, which aims to reach land degradation neutrality by 2030 \citep{waltham2020decade}. Natural forest regeneration is a spontaneous recovery process during which native tree species colonize land following a human-induced or natural disturbances \citep{crouzeillesEcologicalRestorationSuccess2017}. This process is particularly significant in tropical regions, where shifting land use change often leads to land abandonment. Over time, vegetation and soil recover resulting in a formation of a secondary forest \citep{chazdonSecondGrowthPromise2014}.

%The success of natural regeneration, however, is strongly influenced by the spatial context such as the degree of fragmentation and the proximity to surrounding forest \citet{arroyo-rodriguezMultipleSuccessionalPathways2017}. 
%As described by \citet{crouzeillesEcologicalRestorationSuccess2017}, natural forest regeneration is a spontaneous recovery process during which native tree species colonize land after human-induced or natural disturbance.
  % potentially, elaboration on how and why does this happen?

%Subsequently to land abandonment, the soil and vegetation naturally recover resulting in a secondary forest \citep{hordijkLandUseHistory2024}. % here we could add more from Chazdon, 2016 on the importance of tropics in the world
%Moreover, a higher degree of fragmentation limits the movement possibility of animal despersers and lowerproximity to a surrounding forest 

% on secondary succession
In ecological terms natural regeneration is known as secondary succession - a directional change in ecosystem attributes over time following a disturbance. Unlike primary succession, secondary succession benefits from land legacies such as well-established soils and the presence of reproductive units, propagules \citep{poorterSuccessionalTheories2023}. % here a potential to elaborate on the history of succession theories development
Successional theory has evolved over time with 
key frameworks proposed by \citet{pickettHierarchicalConsiderationCauses1987} and \citet{poorterComprehensiveFrameworkVegetation2024}, identifying three main successional mechanisms: (1) site availability, (2) species availability, and (3) species performance. 

The site availability depends on the type, intensity and duration of a disturbance which in turn impacts the seed bank and the remnant vegetation \citep{poorterComprehensiveFrameworkVegetation2024}. Species availability is regulated by propagules that remain at the site after the disturbance and those dispersed into the site \citep{gleasonIndividualisticConceptPlant1926, dentUnitingNicheDifferentiation2021}. These are, however, dependent on the structure, composition and distance to the surrounding forest \citep{dentUnitingNicheDifferentiation2021}. Finally, species performance is determined by species traits, biotic interactions, and the abiotic environment \citep{poorterComprehensiveFrameworkVegetation2024}. Among these, species availability often has the strongest influence on the speed and direction of succession. This is particularly the case for fragmented landscapes where seeds and seed dispersers are distant, scarce, or absent \citep{poorterSuccessionalTheories2023, dentUnitingNicheDifferentiation2021}. 

While these mechanisms are broadly applicable, the factors shaping the successional pathway might vary substantially between ecosystems. For instance, in tropical forests, the process differs between dry and wet tropical forest. In wet tropical forest, succession is more dependent on the landscape connectivity and the availability of seed dispersers, as most tree species rely on animals for dispersal. In contrast, tropical dry forest is dominated by wind-dispersed species and trees that resprout from existing root system \citep{hordijkLandUseHistory2024, lohbeckSuccessionalChangesFunctional2013}.

% a better link would be nice, between these two paragraphs

%In this MSc research I wish to focus on the second successional mechanism, the species %availability. Species availability has always been one of the integral components of %successional theory since the beginning of last century \citep{gleasonIndividualisticConceptPlant1926, arroyo-rodriguezMultipleSuccessionalPathways2017, dentUnitingNicheDifferentiation2021}. 

%The size of the
%largest forest patch and connectivity had the most effect on change
%in tree community attributes during 3 years of succession (Table 3),
%indicating that not only forest presence and quantity but also forest
%configuration in the landscape affect tree establishment. - Hordijk, Land use

% and then how it is important for society and the aim of the study
Understanding the mechanisms of secondary succession broadens our knowledge on how ecosystems respond to a disturbance. This is particularly important in the age of Anthropocene during which global land use and climate change cause severe disruptions in the ecosystems. By understanding the dynamics present in secondary succession, we can design and implement more effective ecosystem restoration strategies \citep{poorterSuccessionalTheories2023}. Therefore, the aim of this study is to understand how forest landscape factors affect seed diversity and dispersal in a dry and wet tropical forest during early succession. 

% definition and further on forest surroundings
Seeds are a fundamental component of secondary succession. As propagules, they function as the source for the development of new plants \citep{poorterSuccessionalTheories2023}. In the first stages of secondary succession, most of the seedlings are sourced from the surrounding forest, but also from the soil seed bank and resprouts of the remnant vegetation \citep{huancanunezSeedrainsuccessionalFeedbacksWet2021}. The landscape factors such as the age of the surrounding forest, the forest cover and the forest connectivity play a critical role in the seed dispersal. If the occurrence of surrounding forest is scarce, the chance of seed dispersal and establishment, and therefore succession, is hindered \citep{hordijkLandUseHistory2024}. Additionally, the forest connectivity is particularly important in this stage, when seeds are mainly sourced from the surrounding forest. In poorly connected forests, animal dispersers have limited options for movement and therefore, transportation of seeds.  Moreover, the distance to nearby seed source and the presence of natural corridors can impact the composition and abundance of seeds available for regeneration significantly \citep{dentUnitingNicheDifferentiation2021, arroyo-rodriguezMultipleSuccessionalPathways2017}.

%As the successional age increases, the number of immigrant seeds decreases and the seed rain composition of present trees starts to resemble those of adult trees \citep{chazdonNaturalRegenerationTool2016}. However, the forest cover and connectivity remain vital for the seed richness and abundance. Moreo


%However, if trees occurrence is scarce in the surrounding area, the succession is hindered \citep{hordijk2023efectos}. With increasing tree abundance and more forested surroundings, the speed and potential for recovery also rise \citep{arroyo-rodriguezMultipleSuccessionalPathways2017}. The surrounding forest and connectivity are particularly important during the first stage of secondary succession when seeds are mainly sourced from the nearby vegetation by biotic or abiotic factors. However, with increasing successional age, the proportion of seeds sourced from surrounding forest decreases \citep{huancanunezSeedrainsuccessionalFeedbacksWet2021}. 

%Unlike seeds from a temperate forest, tropical forest seeds are animal dispersed \citet{dentUnitingNicheDifferentiation2021}. However, the main mechanism of dispersal changes through the different succession stages. During the early successional stage, wind plays an important role in seed dispersal

%Landscapes
%at one extreme: landscape dominated by forested matrices are mainly determined %by local variation of environmental factors since seed abundance is relatively %high, whereas landscape dominated by various land use types will be mainly %determined by factors operating at landscape and regional scale, especially %those which affect production, dispersal, and predating of propagules


% something that might be related to the age of the forest -> "This confirms that early-successional species invest in many small seeds that can travel large distances (e.g., by wind), whereas late-successional species invest in fruits that attract biotic dispersers to allow directional dispersal" (Lohbeck)

% gap
Altough a substantial research has been published on the mechanisms of secondary succession and to its related landscape factors, few studies have investigated the effects of their impact on seed diversity and dispersal comparing dry and wet tropical forest ecosystems. To address this gap, the following research question has been identified: How does forest age, cover and connectivity affect seed abundance, richness and dispersal mechanism in dry and wet secondary tropical forests during early succession? It is expected that seed richness and evenness will increase with forest age, cover and connectivity \citep{chazdonSecondGrowthPromise2014}.

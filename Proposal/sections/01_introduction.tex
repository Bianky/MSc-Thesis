% INTRODUCTION
% •	Start at a broader societal or scientific context (e.g., climate change, sustainability challenges) and then narrow down to the main topic of the thesis. 
% •	Include descriptions of:
    % •	what are general ways (or opportunities) to tackle certain issues (e.g., need accurate information to respond/mitigate climate change)
    % •	What kind of scientific data and methods can be used? 
    % •	What further possibilities are there? (e.g., new satellite data, new technical advancements)
    % •	Avoid including the thesis research goals here (there is a separate section – section 3)
% •	At least 5 peer-reviewed references ( preferably not older than 10 years)
% •	Page indication:1

% RESEARCH NEEDS
% • This section is generally more specific compared to the previous section focusing on questions like what needs to be researched and what the research gaps are. For example, there are new opportunities (e.g. new tools or data sources), but further study is needed to evaluate their use/value.  
% • This section is not to confuse with “societal needs”, it only focuses on research needs. The societal needs/context is already tackled in the introduction section. 
% • The research needs descriptions are often linked with the research questions of the proposal. In other words, with this thesis research, by answering the research questions, your work will contribute to bridging the current research gap. 
% • This section can be combined with the introduction section, but the main content needs to be present. 
% • At least 10 peer-reviewed references (preferably not older than 10 years) 
% • page indication: 1

% RESEARCH AIM AND RESEARCH QUESTIONS
% •	Apply the SMART principle for the research objective (Specific, Measurable, Attainable, Relevant and Time-bound)
% •	Research questions should be linked to research needs/gaps
% •	Avoid closed questions with “yes/no” answer and questions such as “how to” or “how can”. The latter questions involve certain choices in methods. Hence the obtained results can be only specific to the chosen steps/methods. 
% •	To define a clear research question, it is useful to imagine the expected answer to the questions and also the form of the answer: e.g., map, lists, tables, and figures. 
% •	See more explanations on research questions here (Brightspace discovery course for scientific reading and writing)

Tropical forests are vital habitats for a wide variety of species, and due to their high biomass content, they are essential components of global carbon and water cycles.
Tropical forests are the world's key ecosystems accommodating diverse organisms for diverse ecosystems and carbon sink and stock essential for climate change mitigation. However, 

- natural restoration is essential and so good (more effective than active restoration?)
- natural restoration of tropical forests

Forests an essential component of health climate. however climate and source of biodiversity. therefore
Therefore, natural forest regeneration is an essential tool in efforts to restore soil and ecosystem health, and to mitigate climate change \citep{hordijkLandUseHistory2024}.  resto In the tropics over a half of the forest cover has been converted to other land use type \citep{chazdonNaturalRegenerationTool2016}.

during natural regeneration forest regrow into secondary forests

According to ... over half Why is it essentail According to \citet{chazdonNaturalRegenerationTool2016}, over half of the tropical forests have been converted to other land uses the cover of regeenrating forests
According to \citet{crouzeillesEcologicalRestorationSuccess2017}, natural forest regeneration is defined as "spontaneous recovery of native tree species that colonize and establish in abondoned field or natural disturbances".

But not only for climate, but also for biodiversity conservation, soil health restoration and ecosystem services

Natural forest restoration is an essential tool in efforts against climate change.

The alarming rate of tropical forest degradation and deforestation in human modified landscapes
have led to a massive loss of primary forests. Forest conversion to other types of land-uses results in
the loss of biodiversity, land degradation and contributes to global warming. However, forests can
regrow as secondary forests, which have increased in area in tropical regions as a result of land
abandonment. These naturally regenerated forests recover rapidly, attaining 78\% of the values of
neighbouring old-growth forests after only 20 years


Tropical forests are world's key ecosystems accommodating a wide diversity of species, ..., and playing a fundamental role in the global carbon and water cycles \citep{bormaCarbonContributionsSouth2022}. However, over half of the tropical forests have been deforested and converted into other land use types leading to losses of these vital ecosystem services \citep{chazdonNaturalRegenerationTool2016}. 

Therefore, natural forest regeneration is an essential tool in efforts to restore soil and ecosystem health, and to mitigate climate change \citep{hordijkLandUseHistory2024}.  resto In the tropics over a half of the forest cover has been converted to other land use type \citep{chazdonNaturalRegenerationTool2016}.

during natural regeneration forest regrow into secondary forests

According to ... over half Why is it essentail According to \citet{chazdonNaturalRegenerationTool2016}, over half of the tropical forests have been converted to other land uses the cover of regeenrating forests
According to \citet{crouzeillesEcologicalRestorationSuccess2017}, natural forest regeneration is defined as "spontaneous recovery of native tree species that colonize and establish in abandoned field or natural disturbances".

But not only for climate, but also for biodiversity conservation, soil health restoration and ecosystem services

Natural forest restoration is an essential tool in efforts against climate change.

Tropical forests, world's vital ecosystems, are being degraded and deforested at an alarming rate leading to a vast loss of primary forests \citep{lopez-bedoyaPrimaryForestLoss2022}. The conversion of forest to other land use types leads to biodiversity loss, soil and ecosystem degradation and land use emissions. however

Tropical forests, world's vital ecosystems, are being degraded and deforested at an alarming rate leading to a loss of biodiversity, soil erosion, and land use emissions \citep{lopez-bedoyaPrimaryForestLoss2022}. However, they can regrow into a secondary forest during the process of secondary succession.

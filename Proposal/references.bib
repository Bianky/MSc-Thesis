  abstract = {Abstract             A major global effort to enable cost‐effective natural regeneration is needed to achieve ambitious forest and landscape restoration goals. Natural forest regeneration can potentially play a major role in large‐scale landscape restoration in tropical regions. Here, we focus on the conditions that favor natural regeneration within tropical forest landscapes. We illustrate cases where large‐scale natural regeneration followed forest clearing and non‐forest land use, and describe the social and ecological factors that drove these local forest transitions. The self‐organizing processes that create naturally regenerating forests and natural regeneration in planted forests promote local genetic adaptation, foster native species with known traditional uses, create spatial and temporal heterogeneity, and sustain local biodiversity and biotic interactions. These features confer greater ecosystem resilience in the face of future shocks and disturbances. We discuss economic, social, and legal issues that challenge natural regeneration in tropical landscapes. We conclude by suggesting ways to enable natural regeneration to become an effective tool for implementing large‐scale forest and landscape restoration. Major research and policy priorities include: identifying and modeling the ecological and economic conditions where natural regeneration is a viable and favorable land‐use option, developing monitoring protocols for natural regeneration that can be carried out by local communities, and developing enabling incentives, governance structures, and regulatory conditions that promote the stewardship of naturally regenerating forests. Aligning restoration goals and practices with natural regeneration can achieve the best possible outcome for achieving multiple social and environmental benefits at minimal cost.           ,              Resumen             En el contexto de los ambiciosos objetivos a escala global de restauración forestal a escala de paisaje, es necesario implementar esfuerzos para que la regeneración natural del bosque se convierta en una opción costo‐eficiente. En este artículo discutimos los principales factores que favorecen los procesos de regeneración natural en paisajes tropicales deforestados. Ilustramos algunos casos en los que la regeneración natural sucedió a la deforestación a gran escala y describimos de igual forma alguno de los factores sociales y ecológicos que dieron pie a estas transiciones. Los procesos de auto‐organización ecológica que generan a los bosques regenerados naturalmente y los procesos de regeneración natural estimulados por los bosques plantados favorecen la adaptación genética local, la persistencia de especies nativas con usos tradicionales, generan heterogeneidad espacial y temporal, y mantienen la biodiversidad y las interacciones bióticas. Estas características en su conjunto le confieren a los ecosistemas regenerados naturalmente, resiliencia a futuras perturbaciones. También discutimos algunos aspectos de carácter económico, social y legal que impedirían que la regeneración natural pueda ser implementada de forma efectiva en un contexto tropical. Concluímos el artículo con una serie de sugerencias para promover la regeneración natural como una herramienta eficaz de restauración forestal a gran escala. Las principales prioridades de investigación y de aspectos de política incluyen: identificar y modelar las condiciones ecológicas y económicas donde la regeneración natural sería una opción viable y permanente de uso del suelo; el desarrollo de protocolos de monitoreo que puedan ser aplicados por comunidades locales; y el desarrollo de estructuras de incentivos y de gobernanza forestal que favorezca los procesos de regeneración natural como uso legítimo del suelo. El incluir y alinear a la regeneración natural con los objetivos y las prácticas de restauración forestal, en su sentido amplio, puede contribuir al logro de beneficios sociales y ambientales múltiples a un bajo costo.           ,              SUMÁRIO             Um esforço global para fomentar a regeneração natural de forma custo‐eficiente é necessário para alcançar objetivos ambiciosos de restauração florestal e da paisagem. Nós abordamos as condições que favorecem a regeneração florestal natural em paisagens tropicais, ilustrando casos de regeneração em larga escala após o desmatamento e usos do solo não‐florestais, e também descrevemos os fatores sociais e ecológicos que fomentaram estas transições florestais locais. Os processos de auto‐organização da regeneração natural que criam florestas e a regeneração em florestas plantadas promovem a adaptação genética local e o estabelecimento de espécies nativas utilizadas por populações tradicionais, criam heterogeneidade espacial e temporal e sustentam a biodiversidade e as interações bióticas locais. Estas características conferem maior resiliência ao ecossistema a distúrbios futuros. Discutimos os desafios econômicos, sociais e legais para a regeneração em larga escala nos trópicos. Concluímos com recomendações para que a regeneração seja uma ferramenta eficaz para implantar a restauração florestal em larga escala. As prioridades de pesquisa e políticas incluem: identificar e modelar as condições ecológicas e econômicas onde a regeneração natural é viável e favorável, desenvolver protocolos de monitoramento para a regeneração que podem ser executados por comunidades locais, desenvolver estruturas de incentivo e de governança e condições legais que promovam a gestão de florestas em regeneração.

With Second Growth, Robin L. Chazdon reveals those assumptions to be largely false, bringing to the fore the previously overlooked counterpart to old-growth forest: second growth. Even as human activities result in extensive fragmentation and deforestation, tropical forests demonstrate a great capacity for natural and human-aided regeneration. Although these damaged landscapes can take centuries to regain the characteristics of old growth, Chazdon shows here that regenerating--or second-growth--forests are vital, dynamic reservoirs of biodiversity and environmental services. What is more, they always have been. With chapters on the roles these forests play in carbon and nutrient cycling, sustaining biodiversity, providing timber and non-timber products, and integrated agriculture, Second Growth not only offers a thorough and wide-ranging overview of successional and restoration pathways, but also underscores the need to conserve, and further study, regenerating tropical forests in an attempt to inspire a new age of local and global stewardship."--Publisher's Web site},

  abstract = {Natural forest recovery is an effective ecological alternative to tree planting in tropical forests under certain conditions.           ,              Is active restoration the best approach to achieve ecological restoration success (the return to a reference condition, that is, old-growth forest) when compared to natural regeneration in tropical forests? Our meta-analysis of 133 studies demonstrated that natural regeneration surpasses active restoration in achieving tropical forest restoration success for all three biodiversity groups (plants, birds, and invertebrates) and five measures of vegetation structure (cover, density, litter, biomass, and height) tested. Restoration success for biodiversity and vegetation structure was 34 to 56\% and 19 to 56\% higher in natural regeneration than in active restoration systems, respectively, after controlling for key biotic and abiotic factors (forest cover, precipitation, time elapsed since restoration started, and past disturbance). Biodiversity responses were based primarily on ecological metrics of abundance and species richness (74\%), both of which take far less time to achieve restoration success than similarity and composition. This finding challenges the widely held notion that natural forest regeneration has limited conservation value and that active restoration should be the default ecological restoration strategy. The proposition that active restoration achieves greater restoration success than natural regeneration may have arisen because previous comparisons lacked controls for biotic and abiotic factors; we also did not find any difference between active restoration and natural regeneration outcomes for vegetation structure when we did not control for these factors. Future policy priorities should align the identified patterns of biophysical and ecological conditions where each or both restoration approaches are more successful, cost-effective, and compatible with socioeconomic incentives for tropical forest restoration.},

Natural forest regrowth is a nature‐based solution to restore forests, but it has rarely been evaluated how this is affected by the combination of previous land use intensity and surrounding forest cover, and how this varies between the two main tropical forest types; dry and wet forests.                                                     Thirty‐three plots were established on abandoned agricultural fields in a dry (13 plots) and wet (20 plots) tropical forest in Mexico and monitored 3\,years for the following tree community attributes: structure, diversity, regeneration mode, potential symbioses with N fixing bacteria and mycorrhizal fungi. Previous land use intensity was described using interviews, and landscape forest cover and fragmentation within a 1000\,m radius surrounding the plots were quantified using satellite images.                                                     Variable importance analyses indicated that land use intensity was more important than forest cover and fragmentation for the state of the tree community attributes after 3\,years. This suggests that previous land use impacts the start of succession and leaves important legacies on the vegetation. Land use intensity, forest cover and fragmentation were equally important in determining the change in tree community attributes over time, indicating that both management practices and dispersal shape subsequently community assembly.                                                     A higher land use intensity decreases tree richness recovery, while size of the largest forest patch decreases tree density and connectivity of these patches increases tree density.                                                     The dry forest had a faster increase in tree density recovery compared to the wet forest through a high initial resprouting capacity and abiotically dispersed trees.                                                                          Synthesis and applications                     : Both a higher land use intensity and fragmented forest landscape decreases the speed of forest recovery, indicating that human actions and landscape transformation shape the course of succession. Restoration in fragmented forest landscapes through natural regeneration is more suitable in areas with low previous land use intensity, higher forest connectivity and abiotically dispersed species. Effective restoration should therefore consider both land use history and landscape forest cover and be tailored to local socio‐ecological conditions.                                                                           ,              Resumen                                                                La restauración de los ecosistemas forestales es esencial para conservar la biodiversidad y enfrentar el cambio climático. Aunque la regeneración natural de los bosques es una solución basada en la naturaleza para recuperar la superficie forestal, todavía no se ha evaluado adecuadamente cómo este proceso se ve afectado por la combinación de la intensidad del uso del suelo previo al abandono del terreno y la cubierta forestal circundante, y qué tanto difiere entre los dos principales tipos de bosques tropicales, es decir, los bosques tropicales secos y los húmedos.                                                     Se establecieron 33 parcelas en campos agrícolas abandonados en un bosque tropical seco (13 parcelas) y un bosque tropical húmedo (20 parcelas) en México para monitorear durante tres años los siguientes atributos de la comunidad arbórea: estructura, diversidad, modo de regeneración, y simbiosis potenciales con bacterias fijadoras de N y hongos micorrícicos. La intensidad del uso del suelo se describió mediante entrevistas y se usaron imágenes de satélite para cuantificar la cobertura forestal en el paisaje y la fragmentación del bosque en un radio de 1000\,m alrededor de las parcelas.                                                     El análisis de la importancia de las variables mostró que la intensidad del uso del suelo fue más importante que la cobertura y fragmentación del bosque para definir el estado de los atributos de la comunidad arbórea después de tres años. Esto sugiere que el uso previo del suelo impacta el inicio de la sucesión y deja importantes legados en la vegetación. La intensidad del uso del suelo, la cubierta forestal y la fragmentación del bosque fueron igualmente importantes para la determinación del cambio en los atributos de la comunidad arbórea a lo largo del tiempo, lo que indica que las prácticas de manejo y más adelante la dispersión dan forma al ensamble comunitario.                                                     Al aumentar la intensidad del uso del suelo se reduce la recuperación de la riqueza arbórea, mientras que el tamaño del parche forestal más grande disminuye la densidad de árboles y la conectividad entre parches de bosque aumenta la densidad de árboles.                                                     En el bosque tropical seco la densidad de árboles se recuperó más rápido que en el bosque húmedo gracias a una alta capacidad de rebrote inicial y a la presencia de árboles con dispersión abiótica.                                                                          Síntesis y aplicaciones                     : Un uso del suelo más intenso previo al abandono del terreno y un paisaje forestal más fragmentado repercuten negativamente en la velocidad de recuperación del bosque, lo que indica que tanto las acciones humanas como la transformación del paisaje moldean al curso de la sucesión. La restauración de paisajes forestales fragmentados mediante la regeneración natural es más adecuada en áreas donde la intensidad del uso del suelo fue menor, y donde hay una mayor conectividad forestal y las especies tienen dispersión biótica. Por lo tanto, una restauración efectiva debe considerar tanto la historia del uso del suelo como las características de la cubierta forestal del paisaje y ajustarse a las condiciones socioecológicas locales.},

  abstract = {ABSTRACT                            Secondary forests are increasingly important components of human‐modified landscapes in the tropics. Successional pathways, however, can vary enormously across and within landscapes, with divergent regrowth rates, vegetation structure and species composition. While climatic and edaphic conditions drive variations across regions, land‐use history plays a central role in driving alternative successional pathways within human‐modified landscapes. How land use affects succession depends on its intensity, spatial extent, frequency, duration and management practices, and is mediated by a complex combination of mechanisms acting on different ecosystem components and at different spatial and temporal scales. We review the literature aiming to provide a comprehensive understanding of the mechanisms underlying the long‐lasting effects of land use on tropical forest succession and to discuss its implications for forest restoration. We organize it following a framework based on the hierarchical model of succession and ecological filtering theory. This review shows that our knowledge is mostly derived from studies in Neotropical forests regenerating after abandonment of shifting cultivation or pasture systems. Vegetation is the ecological component assessed most often. Little is known regarding how the recovery of belowground processes and microbiota communities is affected by previous land‐use history. In published studies, land‐use history has been mostly characterized by type, without discrimination of intensity, extent, duration or frequency. We compile and discuss the metrics used to describe land‐use history, aiming to facilitate future studies. The literature shows that (               i               ) species availability to succession is affected by transformations in the landscape that affect dispersal, and by management practices and seed predation, which affect the composition and diversity of propagules on site. Once a species successfully reaches an abandoned field, its establishment and performance are dependent on resistance to management practices, tolerance to (modified) soil conditions, herbivory, competition with weeds and invasive species, and facilitation by remnant trees. (               ii               ) Structural and compositional divergences at early stages of succession remain for decades, suggesting that early communities play an important role in governing further ecosystem functioning and processes during succession. Management interventions at early stages could help enhance recovery rates and manipulate successional pathways. (               iii               ) The combination of local and landscape conditions defines the limitations to succession and therefore the potential for natural regeneration to restore ecosystem properties effectively. The knowledge summarized here could enable the identification of conditions in which natural regeneration could efficiently promote forest restoration, and where specific management practices are required to foster succession. Finally, characterization of the landscape context and previous land‐use history is essential to understand the limitations to succession and therefore to define cost‐effective restoration strategies. Advancing knowledge on these two aspects is key for finding generalizable relations that will increase the predictability of succession and the efficiency of forest restoration under different landscape contexts.},

We hypothesized that compositional changes during succession in dry forest were mainly determined by increasing water availability leading to community functional changes from conservative to acquisitive strategies, and in wet forest by decreasing light availability leading to changes from acquisitive to conservative strategies. Research was carried out in 15 dry secondary forest plots (5–63 years after abandonment) and 17 wet secondary forest plots ({$<$}1–25 years after abandonment). Community‐level functional traits were represented by community‐weighted means based on 11 functional traits measured on 132 species. Successional changes in functional composition are more marked in dry forest than in wet forest and largely characterized by different traits. During dry forest succession, conservative traits related to drought tolerance and drought avoidance decreased, as predicted. Unexpectedly acquisitive leaf traits also decreased, whereas seed size and dependence on biotic dispersal increased. In wet forest succession, functional composition changed from acquisitive to conservative leaf traits, suggesting light availability as the main driver of changes. Distinct suites of traits shape functional composition changes in dry and wet forest succession, responding to different environmental filters.},

  abstract = {ABSTRACT             Succession is a fundamental concept in ecology because it indicates how species populations, communities, and ecosystems change over time on new substrate or after a disturbance. A mechanistic understanding of succession is needed to predict how ecosystems will respond to land‐use change and to design effective ecosystem restoration strategies. Yet, despite a century of conceptual advances a comprehensive successional theory is lacking. Here we provide an overview of 19 successional theories (‘models’) and their key points, group them based on conceptual similarity, explain conceptual development in successional ideas and provide suggestions how to move forward.                            Four groups of models can be recognised. The first group (               patch \& plants               ) focuses on plants at the patch level and consists of three subgroups that originated in the early 20th century. One subgroup focuses on the processes (dispersal, establishment, and performance) that operate sequentially during succession. Another subgroup emphasises individualistic species responses during succession, and how this is driven by species traits. A last subgroup focuses on how vegetation structure and underlying demographic processes change during succession. A second group of models (               ecosystems               ) provides a more holistic view of succession by considering the ecosystem, its biota, interactions, diversity, and ecosystem structure and processes. The third group (               landscape               ) considers a larger spatial scale and includes the effect of the surrounding landscape matrix on succession as the distance to neighbouring vegetation patches determines the potential for seed dispersal, and the quality of the neighbouring patches determines the abundance and composition of seed sources and biotic dispersal vectors. A fourth group (               socio‐ecological systems               ) includes the human component by focusing on socio‐ecological systems where management practices have long‐lasting legacies on successional pathways and where regrowing vegetations deliver a range of ecosystem services to local and global stakeholders.                                         The four groups of models differ in spatial scale (patch, landscape) or organisational level (plant species, ecosystem, socio‐ecological system), increase in scale and scope, and reflect the increasingly broader perspective on succession over time. They coincide approximately with four periods that reflect the prevailing view of succession of that time, although all views still coexist. The four successional views are:               succession of plants               (from 1910 onwards) where succession was seen through the lens of species replacement;               succession of communities and ecosystems               (from 1965 onwards) when there was a more holistic view of succession;               succession in landscapes               (from 2000 onwards) when it was realised that the structure and composition of landscapes strongly impact successional pathways, and increased remote‐sensing technology allowed for a better quantification of the landscape context; and               succession with people               (from 2015 onwards) when it was realised that people and societal drivers have strong effects on successional pathways, that ecosystem processes and services are important for human well‐being, and that restoration is most successful when it is done by and for local people.                          Our review suggests that the hierarchical successional framework of Pickett is the best starting point to move forward as this framework already includes several factors, and because it is flexible, enabling application to different systems. The framework focuses mainly on species replacement and could be improved by focusing on succession occurring at different hierarchical scales (population, community, ecosystem, socio‐ecological system), and by integrating it with more recent developments and other successional models: by considering different spatial scales (landscape, region), temporal scales (ecosystem processes occurring over centuries, and evolution), and by taking the effects of the surrounding landscape (landscape integrity and composition, the disperser community) and societal factors (previous and current land‐use intensity) into account. Such a new, comprehensive framework could be tested using a combination of empirical research, experiments, process‐based modelling and novel tools. Applying the framework to seres across broadscale environmental and disturbance gradients allows a better insight into what successional processes matter and under what conditions.},

  abstract = {Remnant trees and forest fragments in agricultural landscapes can be important sources of propagules to facilitate forest recovery. However, many studies simply quantify forest cover in the surrounding landscape as a percentage, with little attention given to species composition, and subsequently fail to detect an effect on recruitment patterns. We assessed the relative importance of the spatial distribution and life‐history traits of 77 tree species on recruitment patterns at a landscape scale in a well‐replicated long‐term restoration study in southern Costa Rica. We censused and mapped potential mother trees in a 100‐m buffer surrounding eight replicate restoration plots and quantified respective tree recruits within each plot. We assessed how mother tree abundance, species life‐history characteristics (seed size, dispersal mode), tree size (DBH, height) and distance to restoration plot affected recruitment at coarse (plot: 50 × 50 m) and fine (quadrat: 3 × 3 m) spatial scales. The presence of a mother tree within 100 m of a restoration plot resulted in a 10‐fold increase in potential mean recruitment. Mother tree abundance was also an important driver of recruit density, and particularly so for large‐seeded (≥ 5 mm) zoochorous species with a fivefold increase in recruit density across the observed mother tree abundance range. An interaction between mother tree abundance and proximity demonstrated that the effect of mother tree abundance on recruit density was important but waned with increasing distance from restoration plots. At the fine spatial scale, proximity was uniformly important; height and DBH of the closest potential mother tree also affected recruit abundance but responses differed by seed size. Results highlight the importance of remnant vegetation composition to the recovery of adjacent degraded habitats, underscoring the outsized role nearby remnant forest and isolated trees can play for the persistence of localized biodiversity.},

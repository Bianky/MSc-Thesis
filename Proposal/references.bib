  abstract = {Abstract             Tropical forests are recognized for their role in providing diverse ecosystem services (ESs), with carbon uptake the best recognized. The capacity of tropical forests to provide ESs is strongly linked to their enormous biodiversity. However, causal relationships between biodiversity and ESs are poorly understood. This may be because biodiversity is often translated into species richness. Here, we argue that focusing on multiple attributes of biodiversity—structure, composition, and function—will make relationships between biodiversity and ESs clearer. In this review, we discuss the ecological processes behind ESs from tropical humid and subhumid forests of South America. Our main goal is to understand the links between the ESs and those three biodiversity attributes. While supporting and regulating services relate more closely to forest structure and function, provisioning services relate more closely to forest composition and function, and cultural services are more related to structure and composition attributes. In this sense, ESs from subhumid forests (savannas) differ from those provided by the Amazon Forest, although both ecosystems are recognized as harboring tremendous biodiversity. Given this, if anthropogenic drivers of change promote a shift in the Amazon Forest toward savanna—the savannization hypothesis—the types of services provided will change, especially climate regulating services. This review emphasizes the importance of deeply understanding ecosystem structure, composition, and function to better understand the services ecosystems provide. Understanding that anthropogenic impacts on biodiversity occur through these three main attributes, it becomes easier to anticipate how humans will impact ESs.           ,              Key Points                                                                Tropical forests' biodiversity promotes diverse ecosystem services (ESs), but relationships between biodiversity and ESs are not obvious                                                     Different ES types are related to different attributes of biodiversity: structure, composition, and functions                                                     Savannization of Amazonia could impact the types of ESs provided by rain forests, particularly climate regulating services},

  abstract = {Abstract             A major global effort to enable cost‐effective natural regeneration is needed to achieve ambitious forest and landscape restoration goals. Natural forest regeneration can potentially play a major role in large‐scale landscape restoration in tropical regions. Here, we focus on the conditions that favor natural regeneration within tropical forest landscapes. We illustrate cases where large‐scale natural regeneration followed forest clearing and non‐forest land use, and describe the social and ecological factors that drove these local forest transitions. The self‐organizing processes that create naturally regenerating forests and natural regeneration in planted forests promote local genetic adaptation, foster native species with known traditional uses, create spatial and temporal heterogeneity, and sustain local biodiversity and biotic interactions. These features confer greater ecosystem resilience in the face of future shocks and disturbances. We discuss economic, social, and legal issues that challenge natural regeneration in tropical landscapes. We conclude by suggesting ways to enable natural regeneration to become an effective tool for implementing large‐scale forest and landscape restoration. Major research and policy priorities include: identifying and modeling the ecological and economic conditions where natural regeneration is a viable and favorable land‐use option, developing monitoring protocols for natural regeneration that can be carried out by local communities, and developing enabling incentives, governance structures, and regulatory conditions that promote the stewardship of naturally regenerating forests. Aligning restoration goals and practices with natural regeneration can achieve the best possible outcome for achieving multiple social and environmental benefits at minimal cost.           ,              Resumen             En el contexto de los ambiciosos objetivos a escala global de restauración forestal a escala de paisaje, es necesario implementar esfuerzos para que la regeneración natural del bosque se convierta en una opción costo‐eficiente. En este artículo discutimos los principales factores que favorecen los procesos de regeneración natural en paisajes tropicales deforestados. Ilustramos algunos casos en los que la regeneración natural sucedió a la deforestación a gran escala y describimos de igual forma alguno de los factores sociales y ecológicos que dieron pie a estas transiciones. Los procesos de auto‐organización ecológica que generan a los bosques regenerados naturalmente y los procesos de regeneración natural estimulados por los bosques plantados favorecen la adaptación genética local, la persistencia de especies nativas con usos tradicionales, generan heterogeneidad espacial y temporal, y mantienen la biodiversidad y las interacciones bióticas. Estas características en su conjunto le confieren a los ecosistemas regenerados naturalmente, resiliencia a futuras perturbaciones. También discutimos algunos aspectos de carácter económico, social y legal que impedirían que la regeneración natural pueda ser implementada de forma efectiva en un contexto tropical. Concluímos el artículo con una serie de sugerencias para promover la regeneración natural como una herramienta eficaz de restauración forestal a gran escala. Las principales prioridades de investigación y de aspectos de política incluyen: identificar y modelar las condiciones ecológicas y económicas donde la regeneración natural sería una opción viable y permanente de uso del suelo; el desarrollo de protocolos de monitoreo que puedan ser aplicados por comunidades locales; y el desarrollo de estructuras de incentivos y de gobernanza forestal que favorezca los procesos de regeneración natural como uso legítimo del suelo. El incluir y alinear a la regeneración natural con los objetivos y las prácticas de restauración forestal, en su sentido amplio, puede contribuir al logro de beneficios sociales y ambientales múltiples a un bajo costo.           ,              SUMÁRIO             Um esforço global para fomentar a regeneração natural de forma custo‐eficiente é necessário para alcançar objetivos ambiciosos de restauração florestal e da paisagem. Nós abordamos as condições que favorecem a regeneração florestal natural em paisagens tropicais, ilustrando casos de regeneração em larga escala após o desmatamento e usos do solo não‐florestais, e também descrevemos os fatores sociais e ecológicos que fomentaram estas transições florestais locais. Os processos de auto‐organização da regeneração natural que criam florestas e a regeneração em florestas plantadas promovem a adaptação genética local e o estabelecimento de espécies nativas utilizadas por populações tradicionais, criam heterogeneidade espacial e temporal e sustentam a biodiversidade e as interações bióticas locais. Estas características conferem maior resiliência ao ecossistema a distúrbios futuros. Discutimos os desafios econômicos, sociais e legais para a regeneração em larga escala nos trópicos. Concluímos com recomendações para que a regeneração seja uma ferramenta eficaz para implantar a restauração florestal em larga escala. As prioridades de pesquisa e políticas incluem: identificar e modelar as condições ecológicas e econômicas onde a regeneração natural é viável e favorável, desenvolver protocolos de monitoramento para a regeneração que podem ser executados por comunidades locais, desenvolver estruturas de incentivo e de governança e condições legais que promovam a gestão de florestas em regeneração.

  abstract = {Natural forest recovery is an effective ecological alternative to tree planting in tropical forests under certain conditions.           ,              Is active restoration the best approach to achieve ecological restoration success (the return to a reference condition, that is, old-growth forest) when compared to natural regeneration in tropical forests? Our meta-analysis of 133 studies demonstrated that natural regeneration surpasses active restoration in achieving tropical forest restoration success for all three biodiversity groups (plants, birds, and invertebrates) and five measures of vegetation structure (cover, density, litter, biomass, and height) tested. Restoration success for biodiversity and vegetation structure was 34 to 56\% and 19 to 56\% higher in natural regeneration than in active restoration systems, respectively, after controlling for key biotic and abiotic factors (forest cover, precipitation, time elapsed since restoration started, and past disturbance). Biodiversity responses were based primarily on ecological metrics of abundance and species richness (74\%), both of which take far less time to achieve restoration success than similarity and composition. This finding challenges the widely held notion that natural forest regeneration has limited conservation value and that active restoration should be the default ecological restoration strategy. The proposition that active restoration achieves greater restoration success than natural regeneration may have arisen because previous comparisons lacked controls for biotic and abiotic factors; we also did not find any difference between active restoration and natural regeneration outcomes for vegetation structure when we did not control for these factors. Future policy priorities should align the identified patterns of biophysical and ecological conditions where each or both restoration approaches are more successful, cost-effective, and compatible with socioeconomic incentives for tropical forest restoration.},

Natural forest regrowth is a nature‐based solution to restore forests, but it has rarely been evaluated how this is affected by the combination of previous land use intensity and surrounding forest cover, and how this varies between the two main tropical forest types; dry and wet forests.                                                     Thirty‐three plots were established on abandoned agricultural fields in a dry (13 plots) and wet (20 plots) tropical forest in Mexico and monitored 3\,years for the following tree community attributes: structure, diversity, regeneration mode, potential symbioses with N fixing bacteria and mycorrhizal fungi. Previous land use intensity was described using interviews, and landscape forest cover and fragmentation within a 1000\,m radius surrounding the plots were quantified using satellite images.                                                     Variable importance analyses indicated that land use intensity was more important than forest cover and fragmentation for the state of the tree community attributes after 3\,years. This suggests that previous land use impacts the start of succession and leaves important legacies on the vegetation. Land use intensity, forest cover and fragmentation were equally important in determining the change in tree community attributes over time, indicating that both management practices and dispersal shape subsequently community assembly.                                                     A higher land use intensity decreases tree richness recovery, while size of the largest forest patch decreases tree density and connectivity of these patches increases tree density.                                                     The dry forest had a faster increase in tree density recovery compared to the wet forest through a high initial resprouting capacity and abiotically dispersed trees.                                                                          Synthesis and applications                     : Both a higher land use intensity and fragmented forest landscape decreases the speed of forest recovery, indicating that human actions and landscape transformation shape the course of succession. Restoration in fragmented forest landscapes through natural regeneration is more suitable in areas with low previous land use intensity, higher forest connectivity and abiotically dispersed species. Effective restoration should therefore consider both land use history and landscape forest cover and be tailored to local socio‐ecological conditions.                                                                           ,              Resumen                                                                La restauración de los ecosistemas forestales es esencial para conservar la biodiversidad y enfrentar el cambio climático. Aunque la regeneración natural de los bosques es una solución basada en la naturaleza para recuperar la superficie forestal, todavía no se ha evaluado adecuadamente cómo este proceso se ve afectado por la combinación de la intensidad del uso del suelo previo al abandono del terreno y la cubierta forestal circundante, y qué tanto difiere entre los dos principales tipos de bosques tropicales, es decir, los bosques tropicales secos y los húmedos.                                                     Se establecieron 33 parcelas en campos agrícolas abandonados en un bosque tropical seco (13 parcelas) y un bosque tropical húmedo (20 parcelas) en México para monitorear durante tres años los siguientes atributos de la comunidad arbórea: estructura, diversidad, modo de regeneración, y simbiosis potenciales con bacterias fijadoras de N y hongos micorrícicos. La intensidad del uso del suelo se describió mediante entrevistas y se usaron imágenes de satélite para cuantificar la cobertura forestal en el paisaje y la fragmentación del bosque en un radio de 1000\,m alrededor de las parcelas.                                                     El análisis de la importancia de las variables mostró que la intensidad del uso del suelo fue más importante que la cobertura y fragmentación del bosque para definir el estado de los atributos de la comunidad arbórea después de tres años. Esto sugiere que el uso previo del suelo impacta el inicio de la sucesión y deja importantes legados en la vegetación. La intensidad del uso del suelo, la cubierta forestal y la fragmentación del bosque fueron igualmente importantes para la determinación del cambio en los atributos de la comunidad arbórea a lo largo del tiempo, lo que indica que las prácticas de manejo y más adelante la dispersión dan forma al ensamble comunitario.                                                     Al aumentar la intensidad del uso del suelo se reduce la recuperación de la riqueza arbórea, mientras que el tamaño del parche forestal más grande disminuye la densidad de árboles y la conectividad entre parches de bosque aumenta la densidad de árboles.                                                     En el bosque tropical seco la densidad de árboles se recuperó más rápido que en el bosque húmedo gracias a una alta capacidad de rebrote inicial y a la presencia de árboles con dispersión abiótica.                                                                          Síntesis y aplicaciones                     : Un uso del suelo más intenso previo al abandono del terreno y un paisaje forestal más fragmentado repercuten negativamente en la velocidad de recuperación del bosque, lo que indica que tanto las acciones humanas como la transformación del paisaje moldean al curso de la sucesión. La restauración de paisajes forestales fragmentados mediante la regeneración natural es más adecuada en áreas donde la intensidad del uso del suelo fue menor, y donde hay una mayor conectividad forestal y las especies tienen dispersión biótica. Por lo tanto, una restauración efectiva debe considerar tanto la historia del uso del suelo como las características de la cubierta forestal del paisaje y ajustarse a las condiciones socioecológicas locales.},

Here, we provide a global synthesis of forest degradation or deforestation using 48 studies published in peer‐reviewed journals that use dung beetles as indicators given their sensitivity to anthropogenic disturbance and their relevance in performing essential ecological functions in terrestrial ecosystems.                                                     We evaluated forest cover associated with undisturbed primary forest degradation (i.e. degraded primary forest) and undisturbed primary forest deforestation (i.e. secondary forest, forestry plantations and forestry restoration implementation) on species richness, total abundance, biomass, functional groups' presence and ecological functions provided by dung beetles. Additionally, we determined whether if dung beetle responses to forest disturbances were geographically dependent.                                                     We found lower diversity and a decrease in ecological functions associated with all classes of disturbance in primary forest. However, the effects were less severe in the case of forest degradation compared to complete deforestation with natural regeneration of secondary forest, development of forest plantations or active forest restoration by planting indigenous trees. The Neotropical and Oriental regions are particularly vulnerable, given the elevated rates of undisturbed primary forest deforestation and its negative impact on their assemblages' diversity and ecological functions.                                                                          Synthesis and applications                     . Our results show that efforts for the conservation of remaining undisturbed primary forests need to be prioritized, especially in tropical latitudes. However, in regions where primary forest conservation is not feasible, logging management programs in degraded primary forest may have a potential role in reducing negative impacts for dung beetle diversity and ecological functions. Moreover, we conclude that despite the negative effect of primary forest deforestation and implementation of secondary forest, forestry plantation and forestry restoration, they can be useful for partial recovery of diversity and ecological functions performed by dung beetles in areas lacking any primary forest (undisturbed or degraded) vegetation cover.},

  abstract = {ABSTRACT             Succession is a fundamental concept in ecology because it indicates how species populations, communities, and ecosystems change over time on new substrate or after a disturbance. A mechanistic understanding of succession is needed to predict how ecosystems will respond to land‐use change and to design effective ecosystem restoration strategies. Yet, despite a century of conceptual advances a comprehensive successional theory is lacking. Here we provide an overview of 19 successional theories (‘models’) and their key points, group them based on conceptual similarity, explain conceptual development in successional ideas and provide suggestions how to move forward.                            Four groups of models can be recognised. The first group (               patch \& plants               ) focuses on plants at the patch level and consists of three subgroups that originated in the early 20th century. One subgroup focuses on the processes (dispersal, establishment, and performance) that operate sequentially during succession. Another subgroup emphasises individualistic species responses during succession, and how this is driven by species traits. A last subgroup focuses on how vegetation structure and underlying demographic processes change during succession. A second group of models (               ecosystems               ) provides a more holistic view of succession by considering the ecosystem, its biota, interactions, diversity, and ecosystem structure and processes. The third group (               landscape               ) considers a larger spatial scale and includes the effect of the surrounding landscape matrix on succession as the distance to neighbouring vegetation patches determines the potential for seed dispersal, and the quality of the neighbouring patches determines the abundance and composition of seed sources and biotic dispersal vectors. A fourth group (               socio‐ecological systems               ) includes the human component by focusing on socio‐ecological systems where management practices have long‐lasting legacies on successional pathways and where regrowing vegetations deliver a range of ecosystem services to local and global stakeholders.                                         The four groups of models differ in spatial scale (patch, landscape) or organisational level (plant species, ecosystem, socio‐ecological system), increase in scale and scope, and reflect the increasingly broader perspective on succession over time. They coincide approximately with four periods that reflect the prevailing view of succession of that time, although all views still coexist. The four successional views are:               succession of plants               (from 1910 onwards) where succession was seen through the lens of species replacement;               succession of communities and ecosystems               (from 1965 onwards) when there was a more holistic view of succession;               succession in landscapes               (from 2000 onwards) when it was realised that the structure and composition of landscapes strongly impact successional pathways, and increased remote‐sensing technology allowed for a better quantification of the landscape context; and               succession with people               (from 2015 onwards) when it was realised that people and societal drivers have strong effects on successional pathways, that ecosystem processes and services are important for human well‐being, and that restoration is most successful when it is done by and for local people.                          Our review suggests that the hierarchical successional framework of Pickett is the best starting point to move forward as this framework already includes several factors, and because it is flexible, enabling application to different systems. The framework focuses mainly on species replacement and could be improved by focusing on succession occurring at different hierarchical scales (population, community, ecosystem, socio‐ecological system), and by integrating it with more recent developments and other successional models: by considering different spatial scales (landscape, region), temporal scales (ecosystem processes occurring over centuries, and evolution), and by taking the effects of the surrounding landscape (landscape integrity and composition, the disperser community) and societal factors (previous and current land‐use intensity) into account. Such a new, comprehensive framework could be tested using a combination of empirical research, experiments, process‐based modelling and novel tools. Applying the framework to seres across broadscale environmental and disturbance gradients allows a better insight into what successional processes matter and under what conditions.},

  abstract = {Remnant trees and forest fragments in agricultural landscapes can be important sources of propagules to facilitate forest recovery. However, many studies simply quantify forest cover in the surrounding landscape as a percentage, with little attention given to species composition, and subsequently fail to detect an effect on recruitment patterns. We assessed the relative importance of the spatial distribution and life‐history traits of 77 tree species on recruitment patterns at a landscape scale in a well‐replicated long‐term restoration study in southern Costa Rica. We censused and mapped potential mother trees in a 100‐m buffer surrounding eight replicate restoration plots and quantified respective tree recruits within each plot. We assessed how mother tree abundance, species life‐history characteristics (seed size, dispersal mode), tree size (DBH, height) and distance to restoration plot affected recruitment at coarse (plot: 50 × 50 m) and fine (quadrat: 3 × 3 m) spatial scales. The presence of a mother tree within 100 m of a restoration plot resulted in a 10‐fold increase in potential mean recruitment. Mother tree abundance was also an important driver of recruit density, and particularly so for large‐seeded (≥ 5 mm) zoochorous species with a fivefold increase in recruit density across the observed mother tree abundance range. An interaction between mother tree abundance and proximity demonstrated that the effect of mother tree abundance on recruit density was important but waned with increasing distance from restoration plots. At the fine spatial scale, proximity was uniformly important; height and DBH of the closest potential mother tree also affected recruit abundance but responses differed by seed size. Results highlight the importance of remnant vegetation composition to the recovery of adjacent degraded habitats, underscoring the outsized role nearby remnant forest and isolated trees can play for the persistence of localized biodiversity.},
